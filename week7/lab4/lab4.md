# Lab 4

## Step 4

Logging into ieng6 with my private ssh key. I'll be doing it locally from here on out. Locally means I will be doing the rest of the lab on my local machine insteaed of the ieng6 server. I do so because I have been using my personal github account, and I refuse to store my private keys which I use for more than just github on our school's servers. Not because I don't trust our school's security, but I trust myself to forget to remove them from the server. In addition, all actions taken on the ieng6 server would be logged and sent to a system administrator, so even if my key is password protected, it is still going to be available somewhere which I don't want.
